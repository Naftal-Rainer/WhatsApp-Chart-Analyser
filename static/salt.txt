01/04/2021, 17:06 - Wincer: PLEASE SEND THIS MSG TWICE TO ANY GROUP. ONCE TODAY AND ONCE TOMORROW. 


*Important Message for all* 

The hot water you  
     drink is good for your throat. 

But this corona   
      virus is hidden behind the 
      paranasal sinus of your nose for 3 to 4 days. 

The hot water we 
      drink does not reach there. 

After 4 to 5 days  
    this virus that   
    was hidden behind the  
   paranasal sinus reaches your lungs.

 Then you have trouble breathing.

That's why it is very important to take steam, 

which reaches the  
    back of your paranasal sinus.

 You have to kill this  
   virus in the nose with steam.

At 50°C, this virus becomes disabled i.e. paralyzed. 

At 60°C this virus  
    becomes so weak that any 
     human immunity  
     system can fight against it.

 At 70°C this virus dies completely.

This is what steam does. 

The entire public    
    health department knows this.

 But everyone wants to take   
    advantage of this pandemic. 

So they don't share this information openly.

One who stays at home should take steam once a day. 

If you go to the market to buy   
    vegetables,
 take it twice a day.

 Anyone who meets  
     some people or goes to office
    should take steam 3 times a day.                      

 *Steam week* 

   According to doctors, 
Covid -19 can be killed by 
    inhaling steam from the nose and mouth, 
   eliminating the Coronavirus.  

If all the people  
   started a steam drive campaign for a week, 

the pandemic will soon end. 

So here is a suggestion: 

* Start the process for a week from
morning and evening, for 
  just 5 minutes  
    each time, 
to inhale steam.  
  
If we all adopt this practice for a week  the deadly 

Covid-19 will be erased.

This practice has no side effects either.

  So please send this message to all your relatives,
    friends and neighbours, 
     so that we all can kill this 
     corona virus together and live and walk freely
    in this beautiful world.

          *Thank you*

🥣 *What Is Inside You*
 
🥬One day a rich man gave a basket full of rotten food to a poor man. The poor man smiled and left the palace with the basket, emptied the basket of it's contents and cleaned it, put beautiful flowers in it and and returned it to the palace and gave it to the rich man.

🍇The rich man was surprised and he asked the poor man why? 
*I gave you a basket full of rotten things and you bring it back filled with beautiful flowers.*

☺️The poor man replied the King: *Every human being gives what is in his heart.*

*What is inside you is what you give out*.

10/04/2021, 07:55 - Wincer: SOME THINGS ARE NEVER DONE

1. Never take your parents to court regardless of the value of the property involved. If God wanted you to have that property, you would have been born with it.
2. Never repossess what you once gave a parent. 
3. Never interrogate parents regarding WHAT THEY DID with the last money you gave them. You can find out wisely.  But once you realise it may raise issues, leave it at that.
4. Never lecture parents regarding their apparent weaknesses. You have not outlived them. And you haven't lived long enough. 
5. A parent may take you to court, repossess what he gave you, interrogate you and even lecture you.
6. WISE PEOPLE CAN STAND A PARENT'S SPIT ON THEIR FACES. THEY KNOW IT'S A BLESSING IN 
DISGUISE. 
7. You will never be rich enough to do a parent any favour. All you do for them is a privilege of service. They birthed you but you can never birth them. You simply cannot pay them in kind!!!
8. IF YOU CAN BUY LIFE, THEN YOU CAN LECTURE FATHERS & MOTHERS REGARDING THE HELP YOU HAVE GIVEN them.

9  Parents are treasure on this land and sooner than you think, that treasure will be buried. Appreciate your parents while you still can.

Today lets make lots of  prayers for our beloved parents. 

I FOUND IT SOMEWHERE AND I THOUGHT IT IS WORTH SHARING

10/04/2021, 10:03 - Daa: *Eating Fruit on Empty Stomach: by Prof. Ken Anugweje, UNIPORT.*

This will open your eyes!
Read to the end; and then, send it to Others on your list as I just did to you!

*Prof Anugweje treats terminal ill Cancer patients by an* *"unorthodox" way and many patients recovered. He is also a sports medicine specialist.*
*He insists that all athletes eat fruits on empty stomach.*

Before he used solar energy to clear the illnesses of his patients, he believes on natural healing in the body against illnesses. See his article below.

It is one of the strategies to heal cancer. As of late, my success rate in curing Cancer is about 80%.

Cancer patients shouldn't die. The cure for cancer is already found - its in the way we eat fruits.

It is whether you believe it or not.

*I am sorry for the hundreds of Cancer patients who die under the conventional treatments.*

*EATING FRUITS*

We all think eating fruits means just buying fruits, cutting it and just popping it into our mouths.

It's not as easy as you think. It's important to know how and when to eat the fruits.

*What is the correct way of eating fruits?*

*IT MEANS NOT EATING FRUITS AFTER YOUR MEALS!*

*FRUITS SHOULD BE EATEN ON AN EMPTY STOMACH:*

*If you eat fruits on empty stomach, it will play a major role to detoxify your system, supplying you with a great deal of energy for weight loss and other life activities.*

*FRUIT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FOOD.*

Let's say you eat two slices of bread and then a slice of fruit.

*The slice of fruit is ready to go straight through the stomach into the intestines, but it is prevented from doing so due to the bread taken before the fruit.*

*In the meantime the whole meal of bread & fruit rots and ferments and turns to acid.*

The minute the fruit comes into contact with the food in the stomach and digestive juices, the entire mass of food begins to spoil.

*So please eat your fruits on an empty stomach or before your meals!*

You have heard people complaining : 
Every time I eat watermelon I burp, when I eat durian my stomach bloats up, when I eat a banana I feel like running to the toilet, etc.. etc..

*Actually all this will not arise if you eat the fruit on an empty stomach.*

The fruit mixes with the putrefying of other food and produces gas and hence you will bloat !

*Greying hair, balding, nervous outburst and dark circles under the eyes all these will NOT happen if you take fruits on an empty stomach.*

*There is no such thing as some fruits, like orange and lemon are acidic, because all fruits become alkaline in our body, according to Dr. Herbert Shelton who did research on this matter.*

If you have mastered the correct way of eating fruits, you have the  SECRET of beauty, longevity, health, energy, happiness and normal weight.

When you need to drink fruit juice - drink only  fresh fruit juice, NOT from the cans, packs or bottles.

*Don't even drink juice that has been heated up.*

*Don't eat cooked fruits because you don't get the nutrients at all.*

You only get its taste.
Cooking destroys all the vitamins.

But eating a whole fruit is better than drinking the juice.

If you should drink the fresh fruit juice, drink it mouthful by mouthful slowly, because you must let it mix with your saliva before swallowing it. 

You can go on a 3-day fruit fast to cleanse or detoxify your body. 

Just eat fruits and drink fresh fruit juice throughout the 3 days.

And you will be surprised when your friends tell you how radiant you look !

*KIWI fruit:*
Tiny but mighty. 
This is a good source of potassium, magnesium, vitamin E & fiber. Its vitamin C content is twice that of an orange.

*APPLE:*
An apple a day keeps the doctor away? 
Although an apple has a low vitamin C content, it has antioxidants & flavonoids which enhances the activity of vitamin C thereby helping to lower the risks of colon cancer, heart attack & stroke. 

*STRAWBERRY: Protective Fruit:*
Strawberries have the highest total antioxidant power among major fruits & protect the body from cancer-causing, blood vessel-clogging and free radicals. 

*ORANGE: Sweetest medicine.*
Taking 2-4 oranges a day may help keep colds away, lower cholesterol, prevent & dissolve kidney stones as well as lessens the risk of colon cancer.

*WATERMELON:*
Coolest thirst quencher. Composed of 92% water, it is also packed with a giant dose of glutathione, which helps boost our immune system.

They are also a key source of lycopene the cancer fighting oxidant.
Other nutrients found in watermelon are vitamin C & Potassium. 

*GUAVA & PAPAYA:*
Top awards for vitamin C. They are the clear winners for their high vitamin C content.

Guava is also rich in fiber, which helps prevent constipation.

Papaya is rich in carotene; this is good for your eyes.

*Drinking COLD water or drinks after a meal = CANCER.*

Can you believe this ?

For those who like to drink cold water or cold drinks, this article is applicable to you. 

It is not nice to have a cup of cold water or cold drinks after a meal.

However, the cold  or drinks will solidify the oily stuff that you have just eaten.

It will slow down the digestion.

Once this 'sludge' reacts with the acid, it will break down and be absorbed by the intestine faster than the solid food.

It will line the intestine.

*Very soon, this will turn into FATS and lead to CANCER!*

*It is best to drink hot soup or warm water after a meal.*

*Let's be careful and be aware. The more we know the better chance we could survive.*

A cardiologist says: 
if everyone who gets this mail sends it to 10 people, you can be sure that we'll save at least one life.

*So lets do it*

No.2-Hera...
We need to clear this backlog inorder to be fair to all,in line with this,the following are the suggestions,which shall be up for discussion.
1.That Arozy be visited in the month of 1st wkend.
2.That Hera be visited in the month of Aug.1st wkend.
In all such visits of a newborn,each family contributes 5k,for each visit.
Since the children are all grown,we request the parent/host to kindly suggest what they prefer to be bought and that should be within the budget.

21/04/2021, 21:38 - Lynne: Well noted
22/04/2021, 06:23 - Mom Zah: A man, who regularly attended family & group  meetings suddenly, without any notice, stopped participating. 
After a few weeks, one very cold night the leader of that group decided to visit him.

He found the man at home, alone, sitting in front of a fireplace where a bright fire burned.

The man welcomed the leader. There was great calm & silence.

The two men only watched the dancing flames around the logs that crackled in the fireplace.

After a few minutes the leader, without saying a word, examined the logs that formed the fire and selected one of them, glowing most brightly of all, and removed it to the side with a pair of tongs. Then he sat down again.

The host was paying attention to everything, fascinated. Before long, the lone log’s flame subsided, until there was only a momentary glow and the fire soon went out.
In a short time what was previously bright light and heat had become nothing more than a black dead piece of wood.
Very few words had been spoken since the greeting.

Before preparing to leave, the leader picked up the useless piece of wood with the tongs  and placed it again in the middle of the fire. Immediately, the piece of wood was rekindled, fuelled by the light and heat of the burning logs around it.

When the leader was about to leave & had reached the door, the host said: ‘Thank you for your visit and for your beautiful lesson. I'll return to the group soon.’

Why is a group important in our lives ?

Very simple:
Because each member that withdraws takes fire and heat from the rest.

It's worth reminding group members that they are a part of the flame.

It's also good to remind us that we are all responsible for keeping each other's flame burning.
And we must promote the union among us so that the fire is really strong, effective and lasting. Keep the fire burning.

*THE* *GROUP* *IS* *ALSO* *A* *FAMILY*
*It doesn't matter if sometimes we are bothered by so many messages, quarrels and misunderstandings*. 
What matters is to be connected. *We are here to meet, message, learn, exchange ideas or simply to know that we are not alone*

*Let's keep the flame alive.*

*Life is beautiful with family and friends *.
*Stay blessed*🙏🏼✨
*Stay together* 🙏🏼💕
*Together we are Strong*🙏🏼

08/08/2021, 12:13 - Wincer: Excellent article by Dr.Alok Kar -

*WAKE UP PARENTS*
 
Years back, *poor illiterate  parents* produced 
🔹Doctors, 
🔹Engineers,
🔹 Scientists,
🔹 Accountants,
🔹 Lawyers,
🔹 Architects,
🔹 Professors..,  whom I will refer to as *Group 'A'*. 

These *Group 'A'* Children struggled on their own after Primary 6 or Grade 12, to become notable personalities. Most of them 
👉trekked to school *barefooted*
👉went to farms
👉fetched water and firewood
👉cared for domesticated animals
👉did some work including trading after school to survive.

Now Group 'A' ,who have now become Parents themselves are *producing  Group 'B'  Children*
These group B children are 
🔹pampered
🔹 helped in their homeworks or home assignments from nursery school through secondary schools to higher institutions.
 🔹chauffeur driven to very expensive schools or are sent abroad to study.  
🔹they can watch movies from morning till dawn after school.
🔹 they are treated like baby kings and queens.
🔹they don't do any household chores. 
🔹Food is put on the table for them, 
🔹their plates are removed and washed by parents or house maids. 
🔹They are given expensive cars and clothes, 
🔹not forgetting *big pocket money to be wasted* !!!.
🔹Their parents help them in doing their assignments.
🤔 In spite of all these, only few can *speak* or *write* correctly. 😏

🤔Group 'A' Parents  cared for their own *parents* and *children*, Group 'B',their Children are still *struggling to find their feet at age 30+*.‼️ 
🤔They find it difficult to do things on their own because they are used to being helped to think and doing things by Group 'A'. So they can't help themselves, their parents or the society. THEY ABANDON THEIR PARENTS IN THEIR BID TO ACQUIRE THE WORLD

😴 *Where do you belong*❓
🏮Reduce the pampering and the unnecessary help you offer your children.
🏮 Let your children *grow in wisdom, intelligence and strength*. 
🏮Let them face the truth and the realities of life. Teach them to grow  to become *independent adults.* Teach them to 
👉fear God, 
👉respect  others and
👉develop confidence in themselves. 
🤔Parents, discipline your children to become disciplined adults, *useful* and not *useless.*

24/08/2021, 08:08 - Wincer: Life sometimes becomes so hard that when we get down on our knees to talk to God; we cry😭, we cry because our heart is full of pain and hurt. We cry because we feel our hopes are fading. We Cry because we can't find the right words to express our pains anymore and we cry because the wait is eating up our patience.

But I came to encourage your faith from wherever you reading this and to pat your back; tears are prayers too. They travel to God when we can't speak. Our father in Heaven moves with compassion, He Hears, He sees, He feels and He will come through, be strong. ✊🏻

Remember, Great things always come the hard way and takes precious time in the Lord.

Don't give up your Faith, God will surely answer you.

The Lord Bless you...✊🏻🙏🏻❤💪🏻. Good morning.

25/08/2021, 11:42 - Sweet Bro: Observations of a French tourist who visited Kenya recently

_If all Kenyans resolved to work as hard as the traffic police, Kenya would be where Singapore is in less than fifty years. You gotta respect the traffic guys._ 

_It is 6:00 A. M. in the morning and it is drizzling and these guys are on the road to make sure Kenyans travel safely. Once in while you see them stopping a matatu driver and check whether he has all the documents and the prescribed qualifications._

_But I have also noted something about these fellows. Their concern and love for others is simply unparalleled because they don't just check driver  documents and the vehicle condition but sometimes they call the driver aside to find out whether he is doing well. They also make sure they have shaken hands with the conductor._

_You see  such concern and love for the citizens you are serving!_How many government workers bother to find out how their clients are doing or even shake their hands._

 _The traffic police department in Kenya is a classic case study on service delivery to the public._
 
_ Delphine Sabonis (French tourist)

29/09/2021, 07:36 - Wincer: *BATTLE AGANIST A LEADER, IS A LOST BATTLE, NO MATTER WHO IS BACKING YOU*

Dear Leàders,  please hear me very well.
The battle against your Leader is a battle you can Never Win no matter who is backing you.
Don't even attempt it, you can never win it.
You may be anointed to kill Goliath but will forever not be anointed and permitted to kill Saul.
Ask David whenever you see him.
You cannot *ERASE* the man who *RAISED* you.
You cannot *DISHONOUR* the man who made people *HONOUR* you.
You cannot bring *EMBARRASSMENT* to the Man who gave you *ENDORSEMENT.*
Never become a *PROBLEM* to the man who gave you a *PLATFORM* to Rise.
Why become a *WARFARE* to the man who took care of your *WELFARE.*
Determine not to become a *DISAPPOINTMENT* to the man who gave you *APPOINTMENT.*
How can a man put so much *INVESTMENT* into your life, and your "thank you to him" is to put so much *SORROW* into his own life.
In most cases, Leader may be the one who *WRONGED* you. But still remember, the God who *ANOINTED* David to kill Goliath will not *ALLOW* him to kill Saul.
The *DRUNKENNESS* of Noah is not a licence to expose his *NAKEDNESS.*
That will be *WICKEDNESS AND FOOLISHNESS* in the sight Of God.
One of the sons of Noah *EXPOSED* his father's *NAKEDNESS, FORGETTING* it was his father's *RIGHTEOUSNESS* that once *SAVED* him from the *FLOOD.*
Remember, Noah found *GRACE* with *GOD,* yet he found *DISGRACE* with his son.
If you *KNOW* the *WEAKNESS* of your Leader, its because he gave you the *ACCESS* you don't *DESERVE.*
*I AM NOT HERE TO DEFEND THE ERRORS OF LEADER*
Never forget this statement for the rest of your life.
The *PERSONS* who came to *TELL* king David that they have finally *KILLED* Saul his *ENEMY,* were also killed by David as their *REWARD* for *KILLING* a *BACKSLIDDEN PROPHET.*
*THINK ABOUT IT.*
*For those going through the pain of betrayal, heal them and bring them out stronger*

14/12/2021, 19:47 - Wincer: *Dealing With Difficult People in Your Life.*

You will meet difficult people everywhere

(1) In the neighbourhood
(2) At work.
(3) At school.
(4) In the family.
(5) In Political parties.
(6) In Nation
(7) In the Community 
(8) In worship Centers 
(9) At Home
(10) Among friends

It doesn’t matter the number of good things you do, you will still meet difficult people in life.

(1) They will mock you.

(2) They will criticize you.

(3) They will discourage you.

(4) They will fight you.

(5) They will speak negative things about you.

(6) They will tell lies about you.

(7) They will steal your joy and bring you down to zero level...

(8) They will  threaten you to the point of death...

Just remember that
all great men come across difficult people in their journey of life.

*Characteristics of Difficult People*

1) Some are agents of the devil sent to stop you.

2) Some are immature people who need your help.

3) Some are wounded people seeking for revenge.

4) Some are jealous people seeking for relevance.

5) Some are proud people who never want to see anyone above them.

6) Some are failures in life looking for people to perish with.

*What Does the Presence of Difficult People Mean?*

1)  It means there is a great destiny upon your life...

2)  It means there are leadership qualities in you...

3)  It means you are a threat to their camp

4)  It means you have great potential...

5)  It means you are an overcomer

6) It means you are in the right track

 *Way forward*

1. Learn never to give up on your dream.

2. Pursue your dream to reach your destiny successfully.

3. Learn to forgive and forget your haters. Just move on!

4. Learn to yield yourself only to God  Almighty for guidance.

Continue praying, fasting, and forgiving those who hurt you.

Don't forget to pray for your enemies 

Life is a battle ground, fight to win! & Aim to finish well...

  May All mighty God bless me and Everyone of us Accordingly... Amen

20/12/2021, 17:38 - Wincer: *Life is a circle of CONTRIBUTION*

*I contribute.*
*You contribute.* 
*We contribute.* 

*When any party ceases to contribute, the circle will be broken and leakages will be discovered.* 

*Whatever you are enjoying today is someone else's contribution.* 

*Whatever you are lacking today is because someone who is suppose to contribute didn't.*

*Don't be that person, who because he refuses  to contribute, causes leakages to the circle.* 
*Every person on earth is here to contribute to make the world a better place.* 

*Contribution is the essence of living.*
*You can contribute anything useful.* 
*You can contribute in knowledge, in understanding, *in wisdom,  in love, in peace, in resources, and in finances.*
*Also, You can contribute physically, spiritually,  intellectually, financially,  morally etc.*

*When you contribute, people will eat, when people contribute you will eat.*

 *_Ask yourself:_* 

*What is my contribution in that place that I am?*
*What have you contributed to make progress?*
*What is lacking as a result of your refusal to contribute?*
*What is the way forward?*
*The answer explains the scarcity or abundance in that place.* 
*Your presence is irrelevant if you have nothing to contribute.*

*Contribution is the way to go...*
*In the church, contribute.* 
 
*In the organisation that  you are, contribute.* 
*In the school, contribute.* 
*In the house, contribute.* 
*In the market, contribute.*
*In the society, contribute.*
*In the village, contribute*
*In the community,* *contribute.*
*In the family,  contribute...*
 *In your street, contribute.* 
*Everywhere try and contribute...*
*You have something to contribute: Contribute in Love...*
*Instead of complaining, contribute.*
*Instead of destructive criticism, contribute.*
*Instead of being embittered, contribute.*
*Instead of watching, contribute.*
*Contribution is the  right use of energy...*

*Nobody destroys where he has contributed to build.*

02/01/2022, 20:59 - Wincer: Air Commodore Vishal was a Jet Pilot. In a combat mission his fighter plane was destroyed by a missile. He however ejected himself and parachuted safely. He won acclaims and appreciations from many.

After five years one day he was sitting with his wife in a restaurant. A man from another table came to him and said "You're Captain Vishal ! You flew jet fighters. You were shot down!"

"How in the world did you know that?" asked Vishal.

"I packed your parachute," the man smiled and replied.
Vishal gasped in surprise and gratitude and thought if parachute hadn't worked, I wouldn’t be here today.

 Vishal couldn't sleep that night, thinking about that man. He wondered how many times I might have seen him and not even said 'Good morning, how are you?' or anything because, he was a fighter pilot and that person was just a safety worker"

So friends, who is packing your parachute?
Everyone has someone who provides what they need to make it through the day. 

We need many kinds of parachutes– we need the physical parachute, the mental parachute, the emotional parachute, and the spiritual parachute. 
We call on all these supports before reaching safety.

Sometimes in the daily challenges that life gives us, we miss what is really important.

We may fail to say hello, please, or thank you, congratulate someone on something wonderful that has happened to them, give a compliment, or just do something nice for no reason.

As you go through this week, this month, this year, recognize the people who pack your parachute. 

I just want to thank everyone who packed my parachutes last year in one way or the other -- through your words, deeds, prayers etc!! Don't want to take any of you for granted.

Wishing you all a blessed year 2022 with God's blessings...
